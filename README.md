<h1>Air Quality in the Cloud</h1>

<h2>Requirements:</h2></br>
Python</br> 
Flask</br>
SQLAlchemy</br>
Request</br>

<h2>Project Description:</h2></br>
In this project I build a Flask-powered web application that displays data about air quality. This program pulls 100 observations on air quality in the Los Angeles area in Chile from the Open Aq API. The data is stored in a sqlite3 database and then displayed on a local webpage.


<h2>How to Run the project:</h2></br>
Create a python environment that has flask, flask_sqlalchemy, and request installed. Run the aq_dashboard.py file in flask.
